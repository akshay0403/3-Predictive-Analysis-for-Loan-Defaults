# Predictive-Analysis-for-Loan-Defaults
# Overview

This repository contains code for a machine learning project that predicts loan defaults based on applicant profiles. The project leverages historical loan application data and machine learning algorithms to identify patterns indicative of potential default, aiming to improve loan approval processes and minimize financial risk. The analysis incorporates data from two sources: applicant data and previous application data, performing exploratory data analysis to prepare the data for machine learning models.

# Abstract

This project uses machine learning to predict loan defaults, aiding in making more informed lending decisions and reducing financial losses for the lending company. The project involves extensive data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to identify key factors influencing loan defaults.

# Introduction

The goal is to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of loan defaults based on applicant profiles and historical data. This involves analyzing patterns in applicant information and previous loan applications, ultimately aiming to improve loan approval strategies and minimize financial risk.

# Problem Statement

Develop a model to accurately predict loan defaults, enabling the lending company to make informed decisions regarding loan approvals and reduce financial losses.

# Motivation

**Reduced Financial Risk:** Minimizes losses by identifying potentially defaulting applicants.

**Improved Loan Approval Process:** Ensures that capable applicants are not rejected due to insufficient credit history.

**Strategic Lending Actions:** Supports informed actions such as denying loans, reducing loan amounts, or lending at higher interest rates to risky applicants.

**Enhanced Pattern Identification:** Uses EDA to analyze patterns that indicate difficulty in paying installments.

**Data-Driven Decision Making:** Provides a systematic approach to loan assessment based on data analysis.

# Key Points

**Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Load and merge loan application data from application_data.csv and previous_application.csv, handling missing values and outliers.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct extensive EDA to understand patterns, correlations, and key risk indicators using visualizations.

**Feature Engineering:** Create relevant features by extracting and transforming data from the provided datasets.

**Model Selection and Training:** Choose appropriate machine learning models and train them on the preprocessed data.

**Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize model performance using hyperparameter tuning techniques to achieve the best possible predictive accuracy.

**Model Evaluation:** Use metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance in predicting loan defaults.
